# Forage Job Simulations (Personal Archive)

This repository is a personal archive of virtual job simulations I’ve completed on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). Each simulation folder contains materials, notes, and my completed tasks.

## Purpose

I'm using this repo to:
- Keep track of job simulations I’ve done
- Reflect on what I’ve learned from each experience
- Store files and notes for future reference

## Notes

- These are not meant to be polished or publicly showcased.
- This is mainly for my personal learning and reference.
- Some programs may be incomplete or in progress.
